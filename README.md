# The-5-Sannin-
Final Project 

Description of the Project

This project is called Pirate Ship. It is an interactive game that uses Pygame for its visual and interactive effects. 
The aim of the game is for one pirate ship to aim cannonballs at a target (another ship above it). 
The user wins this game if he/she is able to hit the ship within the limitation placed (on the number of cannonballs the user has avaible to be able to hit the other ship) and
being actually able to hit the target. At that point, the game ends.

How does it work?
In order for users to run this game, they would need to have the pygame library installed. Then, users can run the game from the Main.py file. 

Structure of Project/Game and Files 

The project consists of 4 classes (.py files) for each aspect of the game such as cannonballs, target, settings, and the main ship, which is titled ship.py. Then
there is the Main.py file from which you run the game.
